ansible-role-ganeti
===============

This ansible role install a ganeti node with openvswitch.

It has been writen for a ganeti deployment where the physical ports on each
node are dedicated to openvswitch which is talking LACP with the physical
switch in front of it. So the physical machines and the virtual machines are
all plugged in openvswitch, each with a specific vlan configuration.

Still, openvswitch configuration is not yet included in this role, so
everything related to openvswitch should be configured by hand.

Configuration
-------------

Every ganeti node should be in the ``ganeti_nodes`` inventory group.

Common variables in the ``ganeti_nodes`` group :

  - ganeti_cluster_name, ganeti cluster name,
  - ganeti_cluster_ip, IP address of the cluster,
  - ganeti_domain, ganeti cluster domain name
  - ganeti_netmask, netmask of the ganeti network, defaults to 255.255.255.0.

Variables specific to a node

  - ganeti_interface, interface where internal traffic is exchanged between the
    cluster members,
  - ganeti_ip, IP adress dedicated to ganeti on the node.

The ``ganeti_interface`` variable should set on the group level and overloaded
for specific nodes as needed.
